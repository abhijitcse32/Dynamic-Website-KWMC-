		It was a dream of the Founder to establish a women's medical college in the 
		Hospital Complex. With a view to fulfilling the dream and to uplift the medical 
		education among women, KWMC was established in 2001. The motto of the students 
		getting enrolled here is: "Serve the society, serve the nation." With our 
		experience of over 80 years in the field of health and education, we believe 
		that it is our moral responsibility to promote medical services and to make 
		doctors committed to the nation. We train our students to be directly associated 
		with the patients. We want them to play an active role in our village programs, 
		where the doctors and the nurses of the hospital and the students of the medical 
		college work together at the grass root level.
		<br /> <br /> 
		KWMC is one of the institutions of Kumudini Welfare Trust (KWT). Along with 
		Kumudini Hospital, it is located at Kumudini Complex, Mirzapur, Tangail. It 
		covers an area of 110 acres of land. Initially in 2001, KWMC had permission 
		to admit 50 students only. It now enrolls 120 students per batch which includes 
		48 foreign students. At any given time there are more than 600 students which 
		include roughly 150 foreign students studying in this institution. From the 
		very beginning it is a full residential college with all the modern facilities. 
		KWMC has now four different hostels- Jaya Bhaban, Bijoya Bhaban, Aurunima 
		Bhavan and Amiya Bala Bhaban that accommodate approximately 650 students.  
		Since being established, 626 students have graduated from KWMC who are now 
		working in different fields at home and abroad.
		<br/><br/>
		KWMC provides adequate facilities to the students with its spacious 
		lecture halls, well equipped laboratories, tutorial rooms for small group 
		discussion and a spacious dissection hall. It has an enriched library with 
		latest computers and internet connection. Other facilities include students’ 
		common room, canteen and fair price shop. 
		<br/><br/>
		<h1>Kumudini Hospital</h1>
		<p>Nestled on the banks of a river in the impoverished region of Mirzapur, 
		Tangail, the hospital stands as a glorious model of philanthropy. It is one of 
		the welfare institutions established by the founder of KWT, Rai Bahadur Ranada 
		Prasad Shaha. It is a shining example for those who want to improve the 
		situations of impoverished Bangladeshis. Kumudini Hospital along with its 
		affiliated institutions is almost seventy years old and the institution has 
		grown in its scope of philanthropic activities throughout this period. The 
		Hospital started its journey as a dispensary and outdoor facility in 1938. On 
		July 27, 1944 Kumudini Hospital with 750-bed facility was inaugurated by the 
		then Governor of Bengal, Lord R G Casey. In a written address to the guests at 
		the inauguration, Lord Casey summed up the spirit of the endeavor: 
		<i><b>
		“I have come here today because I feel that this hospital affords a high 
		example of what can be done when the initiative, enterprise and public spirit 
		of one man are directed towards the welfare and the well being of the community.” 
		</b></i>

		<br/>
		Kumudini hospital provides free treatment to all those who are unable to afford 
		medical care. It provides treatment for almost all types of diseases. The 
		hospital has its own laboratory with necessary diagnostic facilities. In 
		addition, the laboratory has research and training facilities. 
		The hospital has separate units in Medicine, Surgery, Gynecology & Obstetrics, 
		Eye, ENT, Pediatrics and Dentistry. There are plans to establish modern Cardiac 
		Centre, ICU, Nephrology Centre, and Trauma Centre in the near future. The 
		hospital units contribute directly to the hands-on teaching of the medical 
		students.
		<br/><br/>
		Apart from the general services, the Hospital has a Village Outreach Program which 
		consists of doctors and nurses who periodically visit nearby villages to train the 
		villagers on midwifery, family planning, breastfeeding, sanitation, antenatal and 
		general health awareness. Patients from all over Bangladesh come here for a free 
		health service of a high standard which is not available anywhere else in the country.
		<br/><br/>
		From inception the Hospital provided services totally free of all charges. 
		Since 1993 the Trust started a Patients’ Participation Program. To avail all 
		sorts of outdoor facilities Outpatients (those not requiring hospitalization) 
		have to buy a card worth Tk.10 only which is valid for 3 months. Hospitalized 
		patients do not have to bear the cost of bed charges, the three daily meals or 
		any other services provided to them. Above all a distinctive aspect of Kumudini 
		Hospital is its cleanliness and beautiful environment.
